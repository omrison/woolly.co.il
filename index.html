      <h1>My name is Yael and I am an artist.

I am the owner of "YetzuroTeva - Natural sheep Wool felting".

I live in Taoz with my husband and 3 kids.

I came across ancient wool felting through Waldorf education and was inspired by the magic of the soft cosy feel of the wool.

The versatility of the creative process and the therapeutic quality that comes within, made me understand that this is what I want to do as my life's work. Create and teach.</h1>
      <p>Felting makes me happy. 

It fills me with passion when I explore the wool in it's natural form.

By exploring wool, I also explore my inner world.

Every creation is a piece of my soul.

By looking at my creations, one can feel my love for all living beings of the world and my belief we are all one. 

My creations holds the spirit of the creatures, and every creation empower the one that choose it</p>
